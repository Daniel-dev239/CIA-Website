            <p>CIA is a group of Christian Music Artists that are spreading God's Word and His Love through Music. The full meaning of CIA is "Christ Is All". </br> This was the idea of one of the members (OC Tripp) of the group to start the group since all the members had a passion for Music. (Col. 3:11).</br> The theme verse for the group is Col.3:11."Where there is neither Greek or Jew, circumcision nor uncircumsion, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free, <b>but Christ is all, and all in all (KJV).</b></p>
